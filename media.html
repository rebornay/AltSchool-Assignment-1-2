            <p>It is funny how i tried my best to make this look bad but Mercy said NO! It was really hard coming up with a concept for this design, i prayed for inspiration and God did!</p>

            </video>
            <p>This video is a TV commercial by FCMB, i remember looking forward to it so i could sing along, i didn't know the language or how to search for it. I had hoped; when i grow up, i'll find the real song and thanks to the internet i found it after a decade of hoping.</p>

            </audio>
            <p>This is one of my favourite songs, i listened to this song while growing up, it inspired me. I remember SkyBank used the song in one of their TV commercials back then.</p>
